## Rename Template

The default rename format is:
```
{show} - S{season}E{episode} - {title}.{ext}
```

You can change it in the app using the **"Set Rename Template"** button.

---

## Folder Structure

The tool works best with folders structured like this:

```
Show Name/
â”œâ”€â”€ Season 1/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Show.Name.S01E01.mkv
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Show.Name.S01E02.mkv
```

It will detect and rename files and (optionally) season folders accordingly.
